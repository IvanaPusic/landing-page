            NEAR Balkans Hub is among the first NEAR Ecosystem Regional Hubs set
            up globally. It was established through a collaboration between the
            NEAR Foundation and the Borderless Tech Association. NEAR Balkans
            was created in order to promote and accelerate web3 open source
            eco-system development.
